### WMinesweeper

Play the minesweeper game on your local Java compiler that supports Javax.Swing! To begin a new game, compile and run the program. The game ends when all of the squares on the board turn grey. The number of flags is indicated at the top left, the number of seconds elapsed on the right, and the state of emotion in the top middle; smiling if currently playing, excited if the game has won, and dead if a mine has blown up.
